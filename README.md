## Other Tips
* Just reach out! Introduce yourself, be humble, and talk about why you're a good fit for a company and what you can offer -- even if you don't fit their requirements. Showing dedication, passion, and genuine interest will get you far. 
* Join groups like [Startup PH: Jobs](https://www.facebook.com/groups/277534272382470/) and go to events to look for new, hiring groups.
